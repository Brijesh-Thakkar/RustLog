# RustLog

**A Kafka-inspired append-only log broker for learning distributed systems.**

RustLog is a single-node message broker implementing core Kafka concepts: append-only logs, consumer groups, pull-based fetching, and consumer-owned offsets. It is designed for backend engineers and distributed systems learners who want to understand log storage internals without the operational complexity of a production Kafka cluster.

## Project Scope

**This is an educational project, not production software.**

RustLog demonstrates:
- Append-only segment-based storage
- Consumer group offset tracking
- Binary TCP protocol with framing
- Memory-mapped reads for sealed segments
- Index-based offset lookup

RustLog intentionally omits:
- Replication and clustering
- Persistent offset storage (in-memory only)
- Log retention or compaction
- Authentication and authorization
- Exactly-once semantics
- Consumer rebalancing

**Use this to learn. Not for production.**

## Architecture

RustLog follows a layered design:

**Broker Layer**
- Stateless TCP connections (one task per connection)
- Request routing (Produce, Fetch, OffsetCommit, OffsetFetch)
- Partition registry (topic + partition → Partition instance)
- Offset manager (in-memory consumer group offsets)

**Storage Layer**
- Active segment: writable, uses File I/O
- Sealed segments: read-only, uses mmap for zero-copy reads
- Index files: sparse offset → byte position mapping
- Partition: orchestrates reads across multiple segments

**Protocol**
- Binary TCP with 4-byte length-prefixed frames
- No Kafka wire format compatibility
- Request/response model (no streaming)

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed design.
- Linux, macOS, or WSL (mmap implementation)

### Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd RustLog

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench
```

### Run the Broker

```bash
# Build release binary
cargo build --release

# Run broker (listens on 127.0.0.1:9092)
cargo run --release
```

Output:
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════╗
║        RustLog Broker v0.1.0          ║
║      Distributed Log System           ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝

Broker started on 127.0.0.1:9092
```

### Demo: Producer

In a new terminal, run the producer example:

```bash
cargo run --example producer
```

This produces 3 messages (`["hello", "from", "rustlog"]`) to topic `demo`, partition 0.

**Expected output:**
```
RustLog Producer Demo
=====================

Connecting to broker at 127.0.0.1:9092...
Connected

Producing 3 messages to topic 'demo', partition 0...

Production successful!
Base offset: 0
Records written: 3

  Offset 0: hello
  Offset 1: from
  Offset 2: rustlog

Done
```

### Demo: Consumer (Offset-Based)

Run the consumer in offset-based mode (default):

```bash
cargo run --example consumer
```

This fetches from offset 0 without consumer group tracking.

**Expected output:**
```
RustLog Consumer Demo
=====================

Connecting to broker at 127.0.0.1:9092...
Connected

Offset-based consumer (no group)
Starting offset: 0

Fetching from topic 'demo', partition 0...

Fetch successful!
Records fetched: 3
Next offset: 3

Records:
  Offset 0: hello
  Offset 1: from
  Offset 2: rustlog

Done
```

### Demo: Consumer (Consumer Group)

Run the consumer with a consumer group:

```bash
cargo run --example consumer -- --group analytics
```

This uses consumer group `analytics` to track committed offsets.

**First run (no committed offset):**
```
RustLog Consumer Demo
=====================

Connecting to broker at 127.0.0.1:9092...
Connected

Consumer group: analytics
No committed offset found, starting from 0
Starting offset: 0

Fetching from topic 'demo', partition 0...

Fetch successful!
Records fetched: 3
Next offset: 3

Records:
  Offset 0: hello
  Offset 1: from
  Offset 2: rustlog

Committing offset 3 for group 'analytics'...
Committed

Done
```

**Second run (resumes from committed offset):**
```
Consumer group: analytics
Found committed offset: 3
Starting offset: 3

Fetching from topic 'demo', partition 0...

Fetch successful!
Records fetched: 0
Next offset: 3

No records available at offset 3
```

### Consumer Offset Management

RustLog uses **consumer-owned offsets** (Kafka model):

- Offsets are **explicitly committed** by consumer
- No auto-commit behavior
- Broker stores offsets in-memory per `(group, topic, partition)`
- Fetch with `group_id` uses `max(committed_offset, requested_offset)`
- **Offsets lost on broker restart** (in-memory only)

See [docs/OFFSETS.md](docs/OFFSETS.md) for implementation details.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests (unit + integration)
cargo test

# Run only integration tests
cargo test --test integration_test

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_fetch_uses_committed_offset
```

**Test coverage:**
- 53 unit tests (storage, index, segment, partition, offsets)
- 11 integration tests (end-to-end TCP protocol)
- **64 total tests passing**

## Performance Benchmarks

```bash
# Run read path benchmarks
cargo bench --bench read_path

# Results are saved to target/criterion/
```

**Key findings:**
- **mmap reads: 2.5-3.9 GiB/s** (sealed segments)
- **File I/O reads: 220-1024 MiB/s** (active segments)
- **mmap is 10-18x faster** than file I/O for sequential reads
- **Partition reads: 147 GiB/s** (multi-segment aggregation)

## Design Philosophy

RustLog prioritizes **clarity and correctness over features**:

1. **Simple is better than complex** - Single broker, no distributed coordination
2. **Explicit is better than implicit** - No auto-commit, consumer-driven offsets
3. **Safe is better than fast** - mmap only for read-only sealed segments
4. **Local is better than remote** - File-based storage, no network dependencies
5. **Testable is better than clever** - Extensive unit and integration tests

## Comparison with Apache Kafka

| Feature | Kafka | RustLog |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Replication | Multi-replica with ISR | Single copy only |
| Clustering | Multi-broker with ZooKeeper/KRaft | Single broker |
| Offset Storage | Durable (internal topic) | In-memory only |
| Retention | Time/size-based deletion | Manual management |
| Compaction | Log compaction | Not implemented |
| Security | SASL, SSL, ACLs | No security |
| Protocol | Kafka wire protocol | Custom binary protocol |
| Transactions | Exactly-once semantics | At-least-once only |
| Zero-copy | sendfile() syscall | mmap for reads |
| Consumer Groups | With rebalancing | Without rebalancing |

**RustLog is NOT a Kafka replacement. It's a learning tool and reference implementation.**
